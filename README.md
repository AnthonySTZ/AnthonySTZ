#  📁 Project

## [A2Z Pipeline for VFX Production](https://github.com/AnthonySTZ/A2Z_Pipeline)

A2Z Pipeline is a pipeline tool that can be used to manage files and directories directly from VFX software such as Maya, Mari or Nuke or via the Standalone app.

## [Asset Manager](https://github.com/AnthonySTZ/AssetManager)

This asset manager can be used to store assets and textures, create materials and assign them to assets. It has a standalone version that is used to store files and create materials, and a maya plugin to import assets and textures directly to the current scene.
